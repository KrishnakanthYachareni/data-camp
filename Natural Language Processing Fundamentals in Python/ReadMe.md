## Natural Language Processing Fundamentals in Python
In this course, you'll learn Natural Language Processing (NLP) basics, such as how to identify and separate words,
how to extract topics in a text, and how to build your own fake news classifier. You'll also learn how to use basic libraries such as NLTK, 
alongside libraries which utilize deep learning to solve common NLP problems. This course will give you the foundation to process and 
parse text as you move forward in your Python learning.
